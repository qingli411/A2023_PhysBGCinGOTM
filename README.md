# GOTM-FABM runs for phyiscal-biogeochemical coupling

Notebooks to set up the [GOTM](https://gotm.net/portfolio/)-[FABM](https://github.com/fabm-model/fabm/wiki) simulations to study the interaction between physical and biogeochemical processes in the ocean.

These notebooks make use of the Python tools for GOTM [gotmtool](https://github.com/qingli411/gotmtool), which is included as a submodule.

Run
```
./gotm_env_init.py
```
in `gotmtool/` and follow the steps to set up the environment for gotmtool before running the notebooks.
